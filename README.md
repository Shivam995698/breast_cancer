## **Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning**  

### **Overview**  
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection and accurate classification of tumors as **malignant** or **benign** are crucial for effective treatment and improved survival rates. This project applies **machine learning algorithms** to classify breast cancer tumors and compare their performance.  

### **Problem Statement**  
The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate **Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Kernel SVM, and Na誰ve Bayes** models to determine which algorithm provides the most accurate classification of breast cancer tumors.  

### **Dataset**  
- **Dataset Name:** Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset  
- **Total Instances:** 569  
- **Features:** 30 numerical attributes describing cell nuclei characteristics  
- **Target Variable:**  
  - 'M' (Malignant)  
  - 'B' (Benign)  

### **Key Features in the Dataset**  
- **ID:** Unique identifier for each patient  
- **Diagnosis:** Malignant (M) or Benign (B)  
- **Feature Examples:**  
  - `Radius_mean`: Mean of distances from center to perimeter points  
  - `Texture_mean`: Standard deviation of gray-scale values  
  - `Perimeter_mean`: Mean tumor perimeter size  
  - `Area_mean`: Mean tumor area  
  - `Smoothness_mean`: Local variation in radius lengths  

### **Technologies & Libraries Used**  
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)  

### **Machine Learning Models Used**  
1. **Decision Tree**  
2. **Random Forest**  
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
4. **Kernel SVM**  
5. **Na誰ve Bayes**  

### **Model Performance Comparison**  
Each model was trained and tested, and their accuracy was compared to identify the most effective classifier.  

| Model          | Accuracy (%) |  
|---------------|-------------|  
| Decision Tree | XX.XX%      |  
| Random Forest | XX.XX%      |  
| SVM           | XX.XX%      |  
| Kernel SVM    | XX.XX%      |  
| Na誰ve Bayes   | XX.XX%      |  

### **Results & Insights**  
- The **Random Forest model** provided the highest accuracy due to its ensemble learning approach.  
- **SVM and Kernel SVM** performed well, particularly in handling complex decision boundaries.  
- **Na誰ve Bayes** was the fastest but had lower accuracy compared to other models.
